# PasswordGenerator

This website will utilize the [Gutenberg Project API](https://github.com/c-w/gutenberg-http/) inside of a Docker container to fetch the text of classic novels, and use that text to generate secure passwords that meet requirements.

New skills to be proven for this project:
1)Automation of EC2 instances via Terraform
2)Practical use of Docker images and K8s orchestration
3)Creation of a fully-realized website using Python/Flask
